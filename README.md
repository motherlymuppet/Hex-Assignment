# Hex-Assignment
My final assignment for the "Introduction to Programming" module

I took this module as an elective module in my first year - when I was doing an Engineering degree. This module, and this coursework, convinced me to move to a Computer Science degree.

I don't have a copy of the assignment brief for this coursework. In essence, we were given the interfaces and asked to implement them. Additional marks were available for good user input handling and a strong AI.

I don't have the feedback from this coursework since it was before I switched course. I think I got 98%.
